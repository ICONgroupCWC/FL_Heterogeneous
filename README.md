## Heterogeneity in FL
This repository contains the federated learning algorithm under data sets that are heterogeneous. The algorithm is published in the paper titled 'Federated Learning Games for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces via Causal Representations (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10437657). The distributed implementation of the algorithm described here can be found in the following repository. (https://github.com/ICONgroupCWC/FL_Heterogeneous2) 

Follow the Jupyter Notebook Trial.ipynb 

### Dependencies

1. Tensorflow
2. Keras
3. sklearn
4. seaborn
